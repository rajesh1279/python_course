# python_course
This is my course on learning Python.
I wanted to create one place where all the basics to get started can be found.
I have copied, modified , mix and matched from many resources.
by no means do I claim all this work to be my own. 
I fully acknowledge the contribution of many even though I can't mention all of them.
if you feel your material is copied and wish to be explicitly mentioned.
Feel free to DM me or comment on this repository.
I would love to mention the credit that you truly deserve!!!
